[An article I find interesting: How will ChatGPT change the way we think and work?](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2023/02/will-chatgpt-change-way-think-work)

The article discusses how AI-powered automation is transforming the job market by augmenting human roles, particularly in fields like software development, while raising concerns about job displacement and ethical considerations.

What I find particularly intriguing is how the article discusses the evolving relationship between AI tools and software developers, specifically how it can help streamline mundane or repetitive coding tasks, improving efficiency and allowing developers to focus more on creative and complex problem-solving.
